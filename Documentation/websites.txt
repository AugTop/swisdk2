# Websites

One SWISDK installation can easily serve multiple websites.
They may even be hierachically nested!

The `config.ini` parser searches for sections named `website.xyz`, where `xyz`
is either `default` for the default website or some other name for anything
else.

You can set the following values in the website section:

`title`

: Some descriptive title for this section. Might be used as website title
  later.

`template.base.full`

: path to a website template containing at least a `{$content}` marker.

`template.base.header`

: path to a partial template containing everything up to the
  variable content

`template.base.footer`

: path to a partial template containing everything after the
  variable content

`inherit`

: name of another website this website inherits properties from

`match`

: a regular expression which will be applied to the current URL. If the
  expression matches, the current website section will be choosen.

  If you don't supply a value for match, the URL's first path token
  will be compared to the website name.

`components`

: comma-separated list of components that will always be executed.
  You can either give the name alone (`Navigation`) or you can specify
  a region from your smarty template (`region => Navigation`).

  If you don't supply a region name, the lowercased component name
  will be used.


You might need to add other template paths here if you use some of the
SWISDK2 modules, f.e. `template.article.list`, `template.article.single` etc.


## Example website sections

    [website.default]
    title = Example.org
    template_dir = templates
    template.base.full = path_to_template.html

The following section handles everything below `/admin`

    [website.admin]
    title = Example.org Administration
    inherit = default
    template.base.full = path_to_admin_template.html
    components = Navigation

Special section demonstrating the regular expression matching. We
search for the two paths `/path1.1/path1.2` and `/path2` here.

    [website.special]
    title = Example.org Special subsection
    match = "/(path1.1/path1.2|path2)"
    inherit = default
    template.base.full = path_to_special_template.html
