# SWISDK 2

**Note: this webpage is updated regularly, please check back soon if you don't find what you are searching for**

The Simple Web Infrastructure SDK was born out of the need to simplify
web application development. Its core is very small and easily understandable.
The extension modules enable the developer to easily create multilingual
websites with lots of forms and complex data models.

The developers are currently [Moritz Zumb&uuml;hl](mailto:mail_@_momoetomo.ch)
and myself - [Matthias Kestenholz](mailto:mk_@_spinlock.ch).

## Why another web application framework?

We evaluated many existing frameworks before beginning to write our own.
The form and data handling of these frameworks were not satisfying, plus, many
of them were essentially limited to a single language. We needed a framework
which provided the ability to create multilingual sites without too much
complexity.

## What are the main features of SWISDK?

* Multi-lingual from the ground up
* Easy and automated form and data handling
* Permission system
* Uses smarty as template system (but does not depend heavily on it)
* Configurable error handling
* Creating a new page is as easy as it should be: Just drop a controller
file in the correct place.
* Many building blocks for web applications

## What are the current restrictions?

* Only runs on PHP5-enabled servers
* For now, the only supported RDBMS is MySQL (using the mysqli interface). Support for other RDBMS can be easily added, since all accesses on the RDBMS
are hidden from the user.
* Poor documentation (somewhat mitigated by clean code and lots of comments)

## Where can I download it?

There are no tarballs available, but you can use [git](http://git.or.cz/) or [cogito](http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/) to checkout the
source from our repository.

The following two commands should do the trick:

    $ git clone http://spinlock.ch/pub/git/swisdk2/swisdk.git swisdk
    $ git clone http://spinlock.ch/pub/git/swisdk2/wiki.git webapp
