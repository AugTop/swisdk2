# Permissions

**The permission system and [[realms]] are tightly intertwined. Be
sure to read both pages carefully.**

Read the [[realms]] page for information on how to restrict access
to pages or page trees.

This is an example how you might restrict access to news items:

    DBObject::has_a('News', 'Role');

    $dbo = DBObject::find('News', getInput('id'));
    // we suppose everything went well up to here.

    // get access level of this news entry (minimum role)
    $role_id = $dbo->related('Role')->id();

    // get default group for current URL (you could also 
    // specify another group here, of course)
    $group_id = PermissionManager::group_for_url();

    if(!PermissionManager::check_group_role($group_id, $role_id)) {
        // Oops! Access is denied
        die('access denied');
    }
    // else continue
