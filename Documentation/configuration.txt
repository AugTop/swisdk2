# Configuration

This tries to be a complete list of all configuration variables:

*Note!* Lists are always comma separated

`core.admin_email` (string)

: The site administrator's email address
  This address is used for notifications in case of errors.

`core.name` (string)

: The name of this installation

  This should be unique; it is prepended to notification emails for easy
  sorting in your mail user agent.

`db.database` (string)

: name of MySQL database

`db.host` (string)

: host of the MySQL server (most often this is `localhost`

`db.password` (string)

: password for your MySQL user

`db.username` (string)

: username for the MySQL connection

`dispatcher.modules` (list of string)

: list of subclasses of ControllerDispatcherModule

`dispatcher.*`

: SiteHandler class which handles files with the given extension
  
  Example:

  Handle `/controller/` with file `CONTENT_ROOT/controller_ctrl.php`:

    `ctrl.php = PhpSiteHandler`

  Handle `/static_page/` with file `CONTENT_ROOT/static_page_tpl.html`:

    `tpl.html = SmartySiteHandler`

`error.debug_mode` (bool)

: are error messages displayed on screen?

`error.email_notification` (bool)

: email notification when errors happen?

`error.ignore_error_nrs` (list of int)

: PHP error ids to ignore (see <http://ch2.php.net/error_reporting>)

`error.logfile` (string)

: filename of your logfile

`error.logging` (bool)

: is logging activated?

`git.bindir` (string)

: location of your git binaries (`WikiComponent`)

`runtime.language` (string)

: default language key

`website.*`

: Configuration for websites

  You must provide at least either `fullTemplate` or `header` and `footer`
  in this section!  
  You can also specify a title and a regular expression for the website.

  Example:

    <pre><code>; handle site root
    [website.default]
    fullTemplate = path_to_template.html
    title = some descriptive title

    ; handle everything below /section-b/
    [website.section-b]
    fullTemplate = path_to_sectionb_template.html

    ; handle everything which matches the regex `match`
    [website.some-descriptive-name]
    fullTemplate = path_to_template_xy.html
    match = "/(abc|xyz\/def|section-b\/special-subsection)"</code></pre>

  You can also provide a comma-separated list of components to execute
  always (f.e. a `NavigationComponent`)

  You can give the component name alone (`Navigation`) or you can specify
  a region from your smarty template (`region => Navigation`).


`wiki.basedir` (string)

: location of wiki folder relative to your `content` folder


The following variables are only set while SWISDK is serving a request:

`runtime.controller.class` (string)

: Site class (from `Swisdk::register()`)

`runtime.controller.url` (string)

: The URL to the controller.

  Example:

  Suppose the user requests the page at `/wiki/xyz/page`. You have a file
  `wiki_ctrl.php` inside your `content` folder which handles this request.
  `runtime.controller.url` will be set to `/wiki`

`runtime.includefile` (string)

: the file `DynamicSiteHandler` is going to include

`runtime.language_id` (int)

: the language id

`runtime.navigation.url` (string)

: the URL which `NavigationComponent` should use to build the navigation
  from. This value overrides `runtime.request.uri` if it is set.

`runtime.request.host` (string)

: the host part of the request (f.e. `http://www.example.com`)

`runtime.request.uri` (string)

: the full URL without host for the current request

  For the example above, this would be set to `/wiki/xyz/page`

`runtime.website` (string)

: the current website; see also `website`
