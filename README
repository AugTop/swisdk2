	SWISDK release 2.x <http://spinlock.ch/projects/swisdk/>
		Simple Website Infrastructure SDK

  SWISDK 2 is a web application framework which serves as a building base for
  content management systems, web applications, web services and more.

   The framework has been written with security in mind from day one and
  offers integrated protection from XSS, CSRF and SQL injection attacks.

   Other frameworks are most often lacking in the area of form handling
  and validation -- this is the place where SWISDK shines the most.

WHAT ARE THE PLATFORMS SWISDK 2 SUPPORTS?

   It was built on a standard PHP5 and MySQL 4.1 stack, but has since gained
  support for SQLite, and support for other database engines can be easily
  added.

   Development and deployment has been done on Linux x86 and Mac OS X machines
  until now.
